# Simple Time Interval Consensus Kludge

STICK is a Distributed Consensus Protocol, like PAXOS and RAFT.

STICK has a typical latency of 1-2 seconds between submitting a log entry and receiving confirmation of a durable write.  This makes STICK unsuitable for some use cases.

Time is divided into rounds, typically one second long.  All servers maintain their time using NTP, to an accuracy of tens of milliseconds.

Servers are identified by their static internet IP address.

All messages contain the current round number (Unix epoch time).  Delayed messages are discarded.


## Round Leader

One of the servers is the leader for each round.  The choice of leader is deterministic, based which ```hash(leader address ++ round number)``` is lowest for the current round.  All servers can calculate the leader's identity.  This is Consistent Hashing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing).


## Phase Zero

Nothing happens in the first 100ms of each round.  This slack is used to improve the probability of servers agreeing on the epoch time to near 100%.


## Phase One

### Proto Consensus

A ProtoConsensus contains a reference to the preceeding consensus and one or more log entries (which are just changes to application data).

(If the leader has no log entries to add, there is no need for a consensus this round.)

At the start of the phase, the leader sends the ProtoConsensus to the other servers.
```
{
        "protoconsensus": {
                "round": 5,
                "leader": "1.2.3.4",
                "last_consensus": {"round": 4, "hash":"d86e21cc..."},
                "log_entries": [
                        {"add": {"foo": "bar"}},
                ]
        }
}
```

The other servers may reply with a Vote, if they agree that it is valid.
```
{
        "vote": {
                "round": 5,
                "voter": "2.3.4.5"
        }
}
```

## Phase Two

At the starte of Phase Two, the leader counts the received votes.  If more than 50% of the servers have voted for the ProtoConsensus, then the leader publishes the Consensus.
```
{
        "consensus": {
                "round": 5
                "leader": "1.2.3.4",
                "last_consensus": {"round": 4, "hash":"d86e21cc..."},
                "log_entries": [
                        {"add": {"foo": "bar"}},
                ]
        }
}
```

# Issues 

## One Second Granularity

A round duration of at least one second is required to allow 100ms NTP slack, three 200ms one-way internet trips and time for processing.

This granularity makes Chronsensus unsuitable for many use cases.  STICK has a typical latency of 1-2 seconds between submitting a log entry and receiving confirmation of a durable write.


## Missed Consensuses

If a non-leader receives a ProtoConsensus, which references a Consensus which it has missed, it must catch up.

If a leader has missed a consensus (which the majority have received) the ProtoConsensus which it sends will contain an stale reference.  It will not be voted for by the majority of servers.  There will be no consensus that round.


## Failed Servers

When a server fails, no progress will be made during the rounds in which is should have been leader.

It is expected that there will be many servers.  Individual server failure will only cause a minor degradation to service, with 1/N rounds failing to make progress.


## Clients

Clients' log entries are forwarded to the next round's leader, for incorporation into the next consensus.

A forwarded log entry looks like:
```
"forward": {
        "round": 6
        "last_consensus": {"round": 5, "hash":"e776d61c..."},
        "log_entries": [
                {"add": {"baz": "quux"}},
        ]
}
```

## Adding and Removing Servers

The address of a server to be added or removed can be contained in a ProtoConsensus's log_entries.  A leader will only incorporate a membership change into a ProtoConsensus when it does not change the order of leaders in the near future.
